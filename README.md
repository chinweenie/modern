## Background and Overview

* Build responsive frontend components using React
* Make sure the communication between backend and frontend is instantaneous


## Functionality and MVP

* Users can sign up as company or individual
* User authorization such as sign in and out
* Actions such as creating publications and updating publications for logged in users only
* Interactive and responsive UI such as modal session form
* Search functionality for articles, authors and companies
* Production README


## Technologies and Technical Challenges
